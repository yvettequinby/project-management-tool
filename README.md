# project-management-tool
This project is a fairly simple web-based project management tool. 
It's a sample project to demonstrate a full-stack of technologies.

## Tech Stack
* ReactJS and Redux front-end
* Spring Boot Java back-end application
* Spring RESTful APIs on the back-end
* Secured by Spring Security
* Spring Data and JPA for persistence
* H2 database (might make that MySQL later, but H2 is good for demo purposes)
* Unit Testing with JUnit, Mockito and MockMVC

## How To Build and Run
The back-end is a standard Spring Boot project, built with Maven. 
I'm going to assume that you are familiar enough with Spring Boot 
and Maven to know how to build/run such an application from the command line 
or from your IDE.
The project does use Lombok, so you'll require the Lombok plugins if running from an IDE.
